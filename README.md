👋 Hi, I’m Ben (he/him), a Fullstack Web Developer from the UK!  I'm currently the CEO of Lightning Systems, a major software development company, home to lightningbot.net which is the world's #1 custom Discord bot provider.  I spend a lot of time working on personal projects and freelancing commissions with the primary intent of growing my knowledge.  If you need me (for some reason), give me a shout on Discord (Ben#9651).

💻 While my main focus at the moment is web development, I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Lua, Swift, Node.js, SQL, Tailwind, Bootstrap, React and jQuery.  I'm still learning a lot and trying to spend time working on the ones I love the most, I'm really passionate about the amount I know and am movitated to expand on it every single day!

🛠️ I haven't yet worked on any projects which I plan to open-source, however, once I finish up some public work I may begin to work on something like that.  I'm all for people who share their work with others and I love using non-properitary code to broaden my knowledge in certain areas.  I may be open to collaborations so just send me a message and we can talk!

A few facts about me:
  - 🌎 I like to travel
  - 📝 I love Computer Science and Maths
  - 🌈 I have a boyfriend
  - ❤️ I love all my family and friends
